Cross browser Speech Synthesis; no dependencies.

This project was created, because it's always a struggle to get the synthesis
part of `Web Speech API` running on most major browsers.

**Note:** this is not a polyfill package, if your target browser does not 
support speech synthesis or the Web Speech API, this package is not usable.
  
## Install

Install from npm via

```bash
$ npm install easy-speech
``` 

You can also use the various builds for different targets, see the `dist` folder:

- `/dist/EasySpeech.js` - ESM
- `/dist/EasySpeech.cjs.js` - CommonJs 
- `/dist/EasySpeech.es5.js` - Legacy node compatible
- `/dist/EasySpeech.iife.js` - Legacy compatible build, works even with older 
  or exotic browsers, as long as they support Promises (PRs welcome to transform 
  to callbacks!)

You can use them via CDN:

```html
<!-- esm -->
<script type="module">
  import easySpeech from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/easy-speech/+esm'
</script>
```

```html
<!-- classic -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/easy-speech/dist/EasySpeech.iife.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Import `EasySpeech` and first, detect, if your browser is capable of tts (text
to speech):

```javascript
import EasySpeech from 'easy-speech'

EasySpeech.detect()
```

it returns an Object with the following information:

```javascript
{
  speechSynthesis: SpeechSynthesis|undefined,
  speechSynthesisUtterance: SpeechSynthesisUtterance|undefined,
  speechSynthesisVoice: SpeechSynthesisVoice|undefined,
  speechSynthesisEvent: SpeechSynthesisEvent|undefined,
  speechSynthesisErrorEvent: SpeechSynthesisErrorEvent|undefined,
  onvoiceschanged: Boolean,
  onboundary: Boolean,
  onend: Boolean,
  onerror: Boolean,
  onmark: Boolean,
  onpause: Boolean,
  onresume: Boolean,
  onstart: Boolean
}
```

If at least `SpeechSynthesis` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` are defined you
are good to go.


### Initialize

Preparing everything to work is not as clear as it should, especially when 
targeting cross-browser functionality. The asynchronous init function will help
you with this situation:

```javascript
EasySpeech.init({ maxTimeout: 5000, interval: 250 })
    .then(() => console.debug('load complete'))
    .catch(e => console.error(e))
``` 

#### Loading voices

The init-routine will go through several stages to setup the environment:

- detect and that SpeechSynthesis is basically supported, if not -> fail
- load voices directly
- if not loaded but `onvoiceschanged` is available: use `onvoiceschanged`
- if `onvoiceschanged` is not available: fallback to timeout
- if `onvoiceschanged` is fired but no voices available: fallback to timeout
- timeout reloads voices in a given `interval` until a `maxTimeout` is reached
- if voices are loaded until then -> complete
- if no voices found -> fail 

If your init routing has still not detected / loaded any voices, allthough
speechSynth is supported please leave an issue!

#### Placing a fallback voice

If voices are found it will place a fallback voice by the following rules:

- If there is a voice among all voices with the `default` property set to true
  use this as fallback voice
- Otherwise find the first matching voice by current `navigator.language`
- Otherwise use the first voice in the Array

Note: This fallback voice is not overridden by `EasySpeech.defaults()`, your
default voice will be used in favor but the fallback voice will always be there
in case no voice is found when calling `EasySpeech.speak()`

### Speak a voice

This is as easy as it gets:

```javascript
await EasySpeech.speak({
  text: 'Hello, world!',
  voice: myLangVoice, // optional, will use a default or fallback
  pitch: 1,
  rate: 1,
  volume: 1,
  // there are more events, see the API for supported events
  boundary: e => console.debug('boundary reached')
})
```

The Promise will automatically resolve when the speaking ends or rejects when
an error occurred. You can additionally attach these event listeners if you like
or use `EasySpeech.on` to attach default listeners to every time you call 
`EasySpeech.speak`.
